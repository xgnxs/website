# Sample document

This is a sample document written for the tutorial [*Learn Enoughâ„¢ Text Editor to Be Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/text-editor) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). It's written in [Markdown](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a plain-text format that's both easy to read and easy to convert to HTML. In later tutorials, we'll use Markdown for making README files designed to give a quick overview of a project's contents.
